# Learn React JS with Project

This project was made following the next Dipesh Malvia [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0riHps91AzE).

We cover a lot of react concepts such as react hooks, class components and function components, me we use semantic UI framework.

For the back end we use JSON server package.
